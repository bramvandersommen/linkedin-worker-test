7403705028047417344,Patrick Huijs,“How can we improve our SaaS homepage?” I get this question 100s of times. SaaS founders know that the homepage is the most important page of their SaaS website. Still the struggle with: → Telling their story.→ Keeping users engaged. → Getting users to actually signup. Let’s face it. SaaS founders are great at building their product. Theyre not always so great in turning all that knowledge and passion into something everyone understands. They have an OK website. But they still end up with: → Low signup rates.→ High bounce rates.→ Leaving $$$ on the table. Time to fix that. I’ve created a simple blueprint that you can apply today. Follow the structure and I guarantee you will see an increase in your signup rate. You’re homepage isn’t just your first page.

  Structure beats storytelling that tries to say everything.

  Which single outcome would you pick for your homepage?","Most founders treat the homepage like a product tour, not a conversion funnel.

  That approach buries the signup path and confuses visitors. I recommend a tight blueprint and clear next steps instead of long feature lists.

  Make the path to signup obvious and short.

  Which step feels unnecessary on your current homepage?","When was the last time you treated your homepage as a hypothesis?

  I tell clients to run small experiments on structure and track the signup flow. The wins are often surprising and cheap to test. Reframing the homepage as testable cuts wasted effort.
