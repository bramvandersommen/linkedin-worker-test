# AI Voice Tuning Plan

**Goal:** Get your AI to 95%+ accuracy so you edit fewer than 10% of words in most drafts.

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

Your Google Sheets has posts where the AI generated drafts and you posted actual comments. The gap between what the AI wrote and what you published reveals exactly where it's getting your voice wrong.

**Right now:** You're probably editing 30-40% of each draft.

**After this:** You'll edit <10% of drafts. Most will be copy-paste ready.

**ROI:** 5 minutes saved per post = 50+ minutes/month back in your calendar.

## YOUR TIME INVESTMENT

**Total: 55 minutes over 2 weeks**

| Step | Time | What You'll Do |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Review historical drafts** | 30 min | Rate 15-20 past AI drafts (Good/Bad/Neutral) and add 1-2 sentence notes on WHY each was off. {{DEVELOPER_FIRST_NAME}} will prep the list. |
| **Answer clarifying questions** | 10 min | {{DEVELOPER_FIRST_NAME}} + Claude will spot patterns and ask you to confirm edge cases (e.g., "Do you ever reference client work in sales-related posts?"). |
| **Test V2 drafts** | 15 min | Comment on 5 NEW posts using improved drafts. Flag anything that got worse. |

**That's it.** No workshops, no long meetings, no homework.

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

```
BEFORE (Week 1)            →  AFTER (Week 4)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Edit 35% of every draft    →  Edit <10% of drafts
2/10 drafts perfect        →  5/10 drafts perfect
"Sounds like AI"           →  "Sounds like me"
Review: 2-3 min/post       →  Review: 30 sec/post
```

**Week 4 Success Checklist:**
- [ ] I edit fewer than 10% of words in most drafts
- [ ] At least 30% of drafts need zero editing
- [ ] AI doesn't fabricate stories I never told
- [ ] Questions match MY comment, not the original post
- [ ] I trust drafts enough to post without major rewrites

## TIMELINE

| Week | Milestone | What Happens |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **1** | You review ~20 historical posts | Spend 30 min rating past AI drafts. Bram preps the list, you just add ratings + quick notes. |
| **1-2** | Bram + Claude analyze patterns | We extract rules: "Patrick never claims sales expertise," "Patrick ties stories to Webflow/CMS work," etc. |
| **2** | V2 system prompt deployed | Updated rules go live in Google Sheets config. |
| **2** | You test 5 posts with V2 | Comment as normal. Tell us if drafts improved, stayed same, or got worse. |
| **3** | Adjustments (if needed) | Fix any regressions. |
| **3-4** | Monitor 10-20 comments | Just comment normally. We'll track edit distance in the background. |
| **4** | Success check | Did we hit <10% edit distance? Yes = done. No = one more iteration. |

## NEXT STEP

**When you're ready:** DM Bram "START VOICE TUNING"

**What happens next:**
1. Bram exports 15-20 historical posts from your Comment Tracker (posts with AI drafts + your actual comments)
2. He sends you a simple review sheet
3. You spend 30 minutes adding ratings/notes
4. Bram shares it with Claude for pattern analysis
5. You answer 2-3 clarifying questions
6. V2 goes live, you test 5 posts
7. Done

**Timeline:** Start Week 1, improved drafts by Week 2.

---

## HOW THIS WORKS (BEHIND THE SCENES)

1. **You rate past drafts:** Good/Bad + why
2. **Claude finds patterns:** "Patrick avoids X, always does Y, never claims Z"
3. **Bram updates the system prompt:** Hard rules to prevent repeat mistakes
4. **You validate:** Test 5 posts, confirm it's better
5. **System learns:** Ongoing edit distance tracking shows continuous improvement

**No black box. No guessing. Just systematic improvement based on YOUR actual feedback.**

**Questions?** Ask Bram. This is a proven process—other clients see 50-70% reduction in edit time within 2 weeks.
